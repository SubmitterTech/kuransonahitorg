        "59": "But  the  wicked  among  them  carried out  commands  other  than  the  commands  given  to  them.  Consequently, we  sent  down  upon  the  transgressors  condemnation  from  the  sky, due to their wickedness.",
        "60": "Recall  that  Moses  sought  water  for his  people.  We  said,  “Strike  the  rock with  your  staff.”  Whereupon,  twelve springs  gushed  out  therefrom.  The members  of  each  tribe  knew  their own  water.  Eat  and  drink  from GOD’s  provisions,  and  do  not  roam the earth corruptingly.",
        "61": "Recall that you said, “O Moses, we can no longer tolerate one kind of food. Call upon your Lord to produce for us such earthly crops as beans,  cucumbers,  garlic,  lentils, and onions.” He said, “Do you wish to substitute that which is inferior for that which is good? Go down to Egypt, where you can find what you asked for.” They have incurred condemnation,  humiliation,  and  disgrace, and brought upon themselves wrath from GOD. This is because they rejected GOD’s revelations, and  killed  the  prophets  unjustly. This is because they disobeyed and transgressed.",
        "62": "Surely,  those  who  believe,  those who are Jewish, the Christians, and the converts; anyone who (1) believes in GOD, and (2) believes in the Last Day, and (3) leads a righteous life, will receive their recompense from their Lord. They have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.",

        "69": "They said, “Call upon your Lord to show us her color.” He said, “He says that she is a yellow heifer, bright colored, pleases the beholders.”",

        "72": "You had killed a person, then disputed among yourselves. GOD was to expose what you tried to conceal.",
        "73": "We said, “Strike (the victim) with part (of the heifer).” That is when GOD brought the victim back to life, and showed you His signs, that you may understand.",
        "74": "Despite  this,  your  hearts  hardened like  rocks, or even harder. For there are  rocks  from  which  rivers  gush out.  Others  crack  and  release  gentle streams,  and  other  rocks  cringe  out of reverence for GOD.  GOD is never unaware of anything you do.",
        "75": "Do you expect them to believe as you do, when some of them used to hear the word of GOD, then distort it,  with  full  understanding  thereof, and deliberately? ",
        "76": "And when they meet the believers, they say, “We believe,” but when they  get  together  with  each  other, they say, “Do not inform (the believers) of the information given to you by GOD, lest you provide them with  support  for  their  argument concerning your Lord. Do you not understand?”",
        "77": "Do they not know that GOD knows everything they conceal, and everything they declare?",
        "78": "Among them are gentiles who do not know the scripture, except through  hearsay,  then  assume  that they know it.",
        "79": "Therefore, woe to those who distort the  scripture  with  their  own  hands, then say, “This is what GOD has revealed,”  seeking  a  cheap  material gain. Woe to them for such distortion, and woe to them for their illicit gains.",
        "80": "Some have said, “Hell will not touch us, except for a limited number of days.” Say, “Have you taken such a pledge  from  GOD—GOD  never breaks  His  pledge—or,  are  you saying about GOD what you do not know?”",
        "81": "Indeed, those who earn sins and become  surrounded by  their  evil work will be the dwellers of Hell; they abide in it forever.",
        "82": "As for those who believe, and lead a righteous life, they will be the dwellers of Paradise; they abide in it forever.",
        "83": "We made a covenant with the Children  of  Israel:  “You  shall  not  worship except GOD. You shall honor your  parents  and  regard  the  relatives,  the  orphans,  and  the  poor. you became averse.",
        "84": "We  made  a  covenant  with  you,  that you  shall  not  shed  your  blood,  nor shall  you  evict  each  other  from  your homes.  You  agreed  and  bore  witness.",
        "85": "Yet,  here  you  are  killing  each  other, and  evicting  some  of  you  from  their homes,  banding  against  them  sinfully  and  maliciously.  Even  when  they surrendered,  you  demanded  ransom  from  them.  Evicting  them  was prohibited  for  you  in  the  first  place. Do  you  believe  in  part  of  the  scripture  and  disbelieve  in  part?  What should  be  the  retribution  for  those among  you  who  do  this,  except humiliation  in  this  life,  and  a  far worse  retribution  on  the  Day  of Resurrection?  GOD  is  never  unaware of anything you do.",
        "86": "It  is  they  who  bought  this  lowly  life at  the  expense  of  the  Hereafter. Consequently,  the  retribution  is never  commuted  for  them,  nor  can they be helped.",
        "87": "We  gave  Moses  the  scripture,  and subsequent  to  him  we  sent  other messengers,  and  we  gave  Jesus,  son of  Mary,  profound  miracles  and supported  him  with  the  Holy  Spirit. Is  it  not  a  fact  that  every  time  a messenger  went  to  you  with  anything  you  disliked,  your  ego  caused you  to  be  arrogant? Some  of  them you  rejected,  and  some  of  them  you killed.",
        "88": "Some  would  say,  “Our  minds  are made up!” Instead, it is a curse from GOD, as a consequence of their disbelief,  that  keeps  them  from  believing, except for a few of them.",
        "89": "When  this  scripture  came  to  them from  GOD,  and  even  though  it agrees  with,  and  confirms  what  they have,  and  even  though  they  used  to prophesy  its  advent  when  they talked  with  the  disbelievers,  when their  own  prophecy  came  to  pass, they  disbelieved  therein.  GOD’s condemnation  thus  afflicts  the  disbelievers.",
        "90": "Miserable  indeed  is  what  they  sold their  souls  for—rejecting  these revelations  of  GOD  out  of  sheer resentment  that  GOD  should  bestow  His  grace  upon  whomever  He chooses  from  among  His  servants. Consequently,  they  incurred  wrath upon  wrath.  The  disbelievers  have incurred a humiliating retribution.",
        "91": "When  they  are  told,  “You  shall  believe  in  these  revelations  of  GOD,” they  say,  “We  believe  only  in  what was  sent  down  to  us.”  Thus,  they disbelieve  in  subsequent  revelations,  even  if  it  is  the  truth  from  their Lord,  and  even  though  it  confirms what  they  have!  Say,  “Why  then  did you  kill  GOD’s  prophets,  if  you  were believers?”",
        "92": "Moses  went  to  you  with  profound miracles,  yet  you  worshiped  the  calf in  his  absence,  and  you  turned  wicked.",
        "93": "We made a covenant with you, as we raised  Mount  Sinai  above  you, saying, “You shall uphold the commandments  we  have  given  you, strongly, and listen.” They said, “We hear, but we disobey.” Their hearts became filled with adoration for the calf,  due  to  their  disbelief.  Say, “Miserable indeed is what your faith dictates upon you, if you do have any faith.”",
        "94": "Say, “If the abode of the Hereafter is reserved for you at GOD, to the exclusion of all other people, then you should long for death, if you are truthful.”",
        "95": "They never long for it, because of what their hands have sent forth. GOD is fully aware of the wicked.",
        "96": "In fact, you will find them the most covetous of life; even more so than the idol worshipers. The one of them  wishes  to  live  a  thousand years. But this will not spare him any retribution, no matter how long he lives. GOD is seer of everything they do.",
        "97": "Say, “Anyone who opposes Gabriel should know that he has brought down this (Quran) into your heart, in accordance with GOD’s will, confirming  previous  scriptures,  and providing guidance and good news for the believers.”",

        "100": "Is it not a fact that when they make a covenant and pledge to keep it, some of them always disregard it? In fact, most of them do not believe.",
        "101": "Now that a messenger from GOD has come to them,* and even though he proves and confirms their own scripture,  some  followers  of  the scripture  (Jews,  Christians,  and Muslims) disregard GOD’s scripture behind their backs, as if they never had any scripture.",
        "102": "They pursued what the devils taught concerning Solomon’s kingdom. Solomon, however, was not a disbeliever, but the devils were disbelievers. They  taught  the  people sorcery, and that which was sent down through the two angels of Babel, Haroot and Maroot. These two did not divulge such knowledge without pointing out: “This is a test. You shall not abuse such knowledge.” But the people used it in such evil schemes as the breaking up of marriages.  They  can  never  harm anyone against the will of GOD. They thus learn what hurts them, not what benefits them, and they know full well that whoever practices witchcraft will have no share in the  Hereafter.  Miserable  indeed is what they sell their souls for, if they only knew.",
        "103": "If they believe and lead a righteous life, the reward from GOD is far better, if they only knew.",
        "104": "O  you  who  believe,  do  not  say, “Raa‘ena”*  (be  our  shepherd).  Instead,  you  should  say,  “Unzurna” (watch  over  us),  and  listen.  The  disbelievers  have  incurred  a  painful retribution.",
        "105": "Neither  the  disbelievers  among  the followers  of  the  scripture,  nor  the idol  worshipers,  wish  to  see  any blessings  come  down  to  you  from your  Lord.  However,  GOD  showers His  blessings  upon  whomever  He chooses.  GOD  possesses  infinite grace.",
        "106": "When  we  abrogate  any  miracle,  or cause  it  to  be  forgotten,  we  produce a  better  miracle,  or  at  least  an  equal one.  Do  you  not  recognize  the  fact that GOD is Omnipotent?",

        "108": "Do you wish  to demand of  your  messenger  what  was  demanded  of Moses  in  the  past?  Anyone  who chooses  disbelief,  instead  of  belief, has truly strayed off the right path.",
        "109": "Many  followers  of  the  scripture would rather see you revert to disbelief,  now  that  you  have  believed. This  is  due  to  jealousy  on  their  part, after  the  truth  has  become  evident to  them.  You  shall  pardon  them, and  leave  them  alone,  until  GOD issues  His  judgment.  GOD  is  Omnipotent. ",

GOD  provides  for whomever  He  chooses,  without limits.”",

I restore vision to the blind, heal the leprous, and I revive the dead by GOD’s leave. I can tell you what you eat, and what you store in your homes.

But then you wavered, disputed among yourselves, and disobeyed after He had shown you (the victory) you had longed for.

He has pardoned  you.  GOD  showers the believers with His grace.",
        "153": "Recall  that  you  rushed  (after  the spoils), paying no attention to anyone, even when the messenger was calling  from  behind  you.  Consequently, He substituted one  misery for another, that you may not grieve over anything you had missed, or agonize over any hardship you had suffered.  GOD  is  Cognizant  of everything you do.",

They      harbored thoughts about GOD that were not right—the  same  thoughts  they  had harbored  during  the  days  of  ignorance. Thus, they said, “Is anything up to us?” Say, “Everything is up to GOD.” They concealed inside themselves what they did not reveal to you. They said, “If it was up to us, none of us would have been killed in this battle.” Say, “Had you stayed in your homes, those destined  to be killed would have crawled into their death beds.” GOD thus puts you to the test to bring out your true convictions, and to test what is in your hearts.

GOD controls life and death. GOD is Seer of everything you do.",
